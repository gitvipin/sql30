SQL30 (Release Notes)
-----------------------

0.2.3
--------------
- Allow LIMIT to be specified in read operations.
- Allow OFFSET to be specified in read operation.
- This is helpful when there are high number of records are expected.
  SELECT * from table LIMIT 100 OFFSET 10;
    would give only max 100 records from 'table' starting from row 10.

0.2.2
--------------
- Allow users to specify connection timeout. Default connection timeout through
  sqlite3 module is 5 seconds. Users can override it at schema level or can alter
  it for individual instance.
- Fix for 'ModuleNotFoundError' in API server for Python < 3.5
- Refactoring for support to PostgresSQL (through connection with 3rd party connector)
  e.g. Users can use https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/ to connect to PostgresSQL database
  and override `get_conn_handle` in Schema class and same code shall work for PostgresSQL.

0.2.1
--------------
- Handle Exception for SimpleHTTPRequestHandler across Python2, Python > 3.6 and python > 3.6
- Keyboard interrupt handler in API server.

0.2.0
--------------
- Allow users to redirect db files into a directory based on SQL30_DB_DIR .
- Fix command line utility to start server on a port to serve data of tables.
- Include sanity test into the unit tests which are gating tests for release of sql30.

- Port sql30 to Python <= 3.6 and Python 2 as well.
- SQL30 is available on Python 2 as well.

  This allows users to make behavior predictable on Python 2 and Python3.

- Enable verbose mode based on init param 'verbose'
