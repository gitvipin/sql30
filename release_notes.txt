- Refactoring for support to PostgresSQL (through connection with 3rd party connector)
  e.g. Users can use https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/ to connect to PostgresSQL database
  and override `get_conn_handle` in Schema class and same code shall work for PostgresSQL.

--------------
- Handle Exception for SimpleHTTPRequestHandler across Python2, Python > 3.6 and python > 3.6

--------------
